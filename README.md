# Singleton pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Setup

To execute the project, it will be necessary to install the dependencies by typing the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn install
```

To execute the project it is necessary to transpile the Typescript code to JavaScript. To do this, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn tsc
```

### Use

To execute the project already transpiled into JavaScript, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
yarn start
```
